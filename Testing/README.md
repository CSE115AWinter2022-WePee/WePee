# Unit Tests
This directory contains files detailing unit tests for the modules under the `modules` and `screens` directories. We provide unit tests for methods that return some value, and leave system level functionality tests to the scenario-based tests detailed in [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wSDcgEcyulBXk9gvQOzLFmb-qsUwHeMbZ0j2lvtHlww/edit) document.
