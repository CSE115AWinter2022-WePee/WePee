# Unit Tests
This directory contains files detailing unit tests for the modules under the `modules` and `screens` directories. We provide unit tests for significant methods that that have large effects, and leave all things UI related to scenario-based testing, detailed in [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wSDcgEcyulBXk9gvQOzLFmb-qsUwHeMbZ0j2lvtHlww/edit) document. 

The tests are written pseudocode and the approriate mocks, stubs, or spies are detailed.
